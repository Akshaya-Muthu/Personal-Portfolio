				 <p>I'm Akshaya M a recent Computer and Communication Engineer who graduated in Apr 2024 from SMVEC with an 8.81 CGPA. I've done my schooling at ALPHA English hr sec school. I'm a hardworking and quick learner who always likes to explore new things. Moving with my industrial experience I learned to create dynamic web applications and interactive user interfaces.These professionals work closely with back-end developers, and UI/UX designers to develop responsive and scalable solutions. using frameworks like react,vue,angular.js they form design wireframes and mockups with functional, high-quality websites.I have a great interest and knowledge in front-end development along with that I'm also familiar with database SQL. Moving with my academic activities I've won 3 technical interview college paper presentation events on the topic of Human Gait recognition and classification and an interview college poster presentation on the topic of the role of AI in health care systems. Regarding my final year project, the topic is Human Gait recognition and classification and to give a short explanation this project Gait Recognition and Classification leverage image processing to analyze human walking patterns. By extracting unique features like stride length, and stripe/stance phases, this technology can identify individuals, assess health conditions, and even infer emotional states. Techniques like feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning algorithms are employed to achieve accurate and robust recognition. Moving on with my honors I'm a good team worker and a hard worker and was the class representative and the student ambassador of the idea lab of our department. My short-term goal is to get placed in a reputed organization and my long-term goal is to sustain a remarkable position where I can feel financially independent and can have a feast for my knowledgeÂ andÂ experience.</p>
